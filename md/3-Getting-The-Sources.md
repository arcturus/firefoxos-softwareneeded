**Gaia** lives in **github**

---

And we follow the git flow

---

Fork gaia:<br/>
[https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia]
<img src="img/gaia-fork.png"></img><br/>

---

Clone your repo into your machine:<br/>
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-github-user/gaia.git
```
... and go for some snacks, this will take a while ...<br/>
```shell
cd gaia
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia
```

You are ready to go!
